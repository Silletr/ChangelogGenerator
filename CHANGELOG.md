Hey there! Big changes happening here, so let's dive into what I've been up to and how it might benefit you as a developer working on this project. Let me break down the key updates:

- First off, some sweet new tools are coming your way - `install_proj.sh` for smooth installations with all dependencies like **loguru** and **ollama** included right in one convenient place! 🤩 Plus there's a `.deepsource.toml` file to get the Deepsource setup sorted out quicker than ever before.
- A big shoutout goes to `generate/parse_commits.py`, where I added imports from **typing** and used casting for better Git path handling with Pyright checking in place – just another way of saying 'I've made it more reliable, thanks!'. 🙌 And speaking of git - by adding the necessary paths to `.gitignore` (don't worry if you missed this before), I ensured that our Jupyter notebooks are kept out from source control.
- Lastly, a minor but important tweak in `release_format.md`, where i made sure it works with my unique format for release notes - now it parses commits like never before! 💪 It's all about making this workflow smoother and more customizable to your needs without sacrificing any functionality, just some small tweaks on the fly here.
- I know we had an old branch in `generate/parse_commits.py`, but fear not – it got merged into dev with no issues! That's teamwork for you 👊 (or at least that’s how I like to think of merging branches, hehe).
- Just a heads up about some other changes in the `generate/` and `__init__.py` directories - they might seem small but together make this project feel alive again. It's all for making sure everything is firing on all cylinders when it comes time to release or get back into work mode! 🚀
- And hey, if you need any install instructions with `install_proj.sh`, just reach out and I’ll set up the process in a jiffy - because who wants unnecessary headaches while working on their project? Not me, that's for sure. Let's make this smooth sailing from here!

So there you have it – everything we touched is about keeping your work environment tidy and functional without breaking sweat or coding gimmicks I didn’t mention like React UI stuff because let’s face it - not everyone might need that jazzy interface. Hope these tweaks help in making our project a bit more fun to work with, so grab the latest version (or use `install_proj.sh` if you haven't yet), and happy coding! 🎉 If there’s anything else on your mind about this or other updates – I'm all ears/eyes here for questions - just ask away!
